# Martyr2 Project List

Enclosed within the repository are files repsenting programming problems done to develop skills in problem solving/algorithms. They'll be attempted in whatever language is currently taking my interest while pursing my educations. At the moment, those are:

- Java
- Python

More will be added as my skills continue to grow as a developer. Hopefully I'll be able to complete them in all the langauges I've listed. At least that's the plan at the moment.
